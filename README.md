### Hi there, Patrick here! 🏀

![A bit about me](github-cover-photo.jpg)

I'm a penultimate year Software Engineering and Finance student at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.

I also work part time as a software engineer at ANZ Bank, on the Property Price Predictions team, where I get to work with AWS, Node and machine learning systems on a day-to-day basis.

### YouTube

I'm very interested in the cloud and digital transformation. Over the past two years I've achieved 10 AWS certifications, including both Professional certs, and documented everything I've learned on my YouTube channel.

If you're interested in getting AWS certified, or even just learning more about the cloud, you'll find plenty of resources [on the channel](https://youtube.com/c/PatrickBrett1111].

### Projects

On this Github, you will find a variety of experiments and projects

A super simple one, but one that I'm quite proud of, is HowManyAWS, which tracks the number of AWS services available. There were only 175 when I made this a couple of years ago - as of writing, there are now 239!

You can see it live at [HowManyAWS.com](https://howmanyaws.com).

Right now, I'm working on a few fun side projects, such as an error correction code visualiser and an AI-powered video editor.

Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn - I'm always down to grab a coffee or set up a Zoom call to meet new and interesting people.
