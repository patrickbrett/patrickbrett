### Hi there, Patrick here! üèÄ

![A bit about me](github-cover-photo.jpg)

I'm a penultimate year Software Engineering and Finance student at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, with a 3.9 GPA and a variety of industry experience.

I also work part time as a software engineer at ANZ Bank on the Property Price Predictions team, where I get to work with AWS, Node and machine learning systems on a day-to-day basis.

### üé• YouTube

I'm very interested in the cloud and digital transformation. Over the past two years I've achieved 10 AWS certifications, including both Professional certs, and documented everything I've learned on my YouTube channel.

If you're interested in getting AWS certified, or even just learning more about the cloud, you'll find plenty of resources [on the channel](https://youtube.com/c/PatrickBrett1111).

### üé® Projects

On this Github, you will find a variety of experiments and projects. Some are pretty outdated or lame, but a few are kind of cool.

A super simple one, but one that I'm quite proud of, is HowManyAWS, which tracks the number of AWS services available - a surprisingly difficult feat given their rapid pace of growth. There were only 175 when I made this a couple of years ago - as of writing, there are now 239!

You can see it live at [HowManyAWS.com](https://howmanyaws.com).

Another cool one is [MatchTheCloud](https://MatchTheCloud.com) - a simple and fun game to test your knowledge of AWS offerings. I made this to learn VueJS back in January 2020.

Right now, I'm working on a few fun side projects, such as an error correction code visualiser and an AI-powered video editor.

### ‚òïÔ∏è Let's catch up

Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn - I'm always down to grab a coffee or set up a Zoom call to meet new and interesting people.
