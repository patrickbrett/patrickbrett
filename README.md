### Hi there, Patrick here! 🏀

![A bit about me](github-cover-photo.jpg)

I'm a penultimate year Software Engineering and Finance student at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, with a 3.9 GPA and a variety of industry experience.

I also work part time as a software engineer at ANZ Bank on the Property Price Predictions team, where I get to work with AWS, Node and machine learning systems on a day-to-day basis.

### YouTube 🎥  

I'm very interested in the cloud and digital transformation. Over the past two years I've achieved 10 AWS certifications, including both Professional certs, and documented everything I've learned on my YouTube channel.

If you're interested in getting AWS certified, or even just learning more about the cloud, you'll find plenty of resources [on the channel](https://youtube.com/c/PatrickBrett1111).
